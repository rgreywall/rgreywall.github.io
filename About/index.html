  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm a student who is working towards becoming a UI Designer at <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/" target="_blank">BCIT</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I spend far too much time on Twitter and the other social media pages. I like Architecural Design and Fashion, so I keep up to date with a lot of websites-- two of which I have linked on my homepage. Check them out! I dont miss out on any new trends, especially when it comes to the world of Web Development, so I am also into keeping up to date on a website called Medium.</p>

  <h2>More about me</h2>
  <p>I'm born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I grew up and still live in a small neighborhood/little island of Queensborough, New Westminster.</p>

  <h3>What is my Dream Job?</h3>
  <p>Part of the reason I'm learning to code is because I want to be able to put my own ideas into practice. My dream 'job' would be to build my own product and start my own clothing business. I have always been fond of design and the arts, so it would be a dream to be able to pursue and have that as my life long career.</p>

  <h3>What music have you been listening to?</h3>
  <p>I listen to everything. I mean everything. Off the top of my head, genres like: Alternative, Indie, Rock, Country, Metal, Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, Electronic, Pop, Grunge, Classical, Instrumental. I usually will hear something and Shazam it if I like it, then add to my Spotify.</p>
